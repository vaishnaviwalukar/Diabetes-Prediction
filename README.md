This is a Machine Learning Internship Task 3 at TechnoHacks Edutech
Task : Diabetes Prediction
About the Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Steps Performed in the Task :
Data Exploration
Data Cleaning and Data Preprocessing
Outliers Detection and Removing of Outliers
Data Visualization (using matplotlib , seaborn and plotly)
Gathered Insights from analysis
Selecting Dependent and Independent Features and Train Test Split
Normalization of Data
Building of Classification Model and Generating Prediction
As a result got Logistic Regression as the best model with 82 % Accuracy.
This Project is good for Data Analysis and Predictive modeling Tasks.

I would love If You give Star for My Performance
